On 22 May 2014, the Royal Thai Armed Forces, led by General Prayut Chan-o-cha, Commander of the Royal Thai Army (RTA), launched a coup d'état, the 12th since the country's first coup in 1932,[1] against the caretaker government of Thailand, following six months of political crisis.[1] The military established a junta called the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) to govern the nation. The coup ended the political conflict between the military-led regime and democratic power, which had been present since the 2006 Thai coup d'état known as the 'unfinished coup'.[2] 7 years later, it had developed into the 2020 Thai protests to reform the monarchy of Thailand.

After dissolving the government and the Senate, the NCPO vested executive and legislative powers in its leader and ordered the judicial branch to operate under its directives. In addition, it partially repealed the 2007 constitution, save the second chapter which concerns the king,[3] declared martial law and curfew nationwide, banned political gatherings, arrested and detained politicians and anti-coup activists, imposed Internet censorship and took control of the media.

The NCPO issued an interim constitution granting itself amnesty and sweeping power.[4] The NCPO also established a military-dominated national legislature which later unanimously elected General Prayut as the new prime minister of the country.[5]

In February 2021, government ministers Puttipong Punnakanta, Nataphol Teepsuwan and Thaworn Senniam were found guilty of insurrection during protests that led to the 2014 coup d'état.[6][7]

2006 Thai coup d'état

2010 Thai political protests
Thailand's politics system changed from absolute monarchy to democracy in the Siamese revolution of 1932. More than 10 coups occurred before the 1997 constitution of Thailand, widely hailed as a landmark in Thai democratic constitutional reform, was enacted. Four years later, Thaksin Shinawatra had become the first prime minister of Thailand to complete a full term in office, and his rule is generally agreed to have been one of the most distinctive in the country's modern history.[8] After 2005–2006 Thai political crisis led by the People's Alliance for Democracy, Thaksin was overthrown in a military coup on 19 September 2006, accused of lèse-majesté. His Thai Rak Thai Party was outlawed and he was barred from political activity.[9] Thaksin has since lived in self-imposed exile. He was sentenced in absentia to two years in jail for abuse of power.[10] From abroad he has continued to influence Thai politics, through the People's Power Party that ruled in 2008, and its successor organisation Pheu Thai Party, as well as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship or Red Shirts movement that were crackdown by Anupong Paochinda and Prayut Chan-o-cha army, Abhisit Vejjajiva and Suthep Thaugsuban's Democrat Party government in 2010.


2013–14 Thai political crisis
In the 2011 general election, Yingluck Shinawatra and the Pheu Thai Party (PTP) won a landslide victory and formed the government with Yingluck as prime minister. Anti-government protests, led by former Democrat Party secretary general Suthep Thaugsuban, began in November 2013. Suthep later formed the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) for the purpose of demanding the establishment of an unelected "people's council" to supervise "political reform", seen as a dismissal of Thaksin power. Suthep told PDRC supporters that he had been in talks with General Prayut Chan-o-cha since 2010 about how to exclude Thaksin from power.[11] Similarly, Reuters reported in December 2013 that close friends of Prayut, former army chief, Anupong Paochinda, and General Prawit Wongsuwan were supporters of the PDRC.[12]

Pro-government groups, including the Red Shirts, held mass rallies in response. Violence occasionally occurred, resulting in a number of deaths and injuries.[13] In December 2013, Yingluck dissolved the House of Representatives and scheduled a general election for 2 February 2014. Disrupted by the anti-government protesters, the election was not completed on that day. The Constitutional Court then nullified the election on 21 March 2014.[14] On 7 May 2014, the Constitutional Court unanimously removed Yingluck and nine other senior ministers from office over the controversial transfer of a top security officer in 2011.[15][16] The remaining ministers selected Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan to replace Yingluck as caretaker prime minister as protests continued.[17]

Suthep claimed that before declaring martial law, Prayut told him that "Khun Suthep and your masses of PDRC supporters are too exhausted. It's now the duty of the army to take over the task".[11]

Immediately prior to the coup
Martial law imposition

General Prayut Chan-o-cha, RTA Commander
The RTA intervened on 20 May 2014, when its commander, General Prayut, exercised the power under the act promulgated by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) entitled Martial Law, BE 2457 (1914),[18] to impose martial law nationwide from 03:00. He said through a television pool that the imposition of martial law was due to continuous violence from both sides and was for the purpose of allowing the army to restore and maintain the peace.[19][20]

After imposing martial law, General Prayut ordered the dissolution of the Centre for Administration of Peace and Order, a police body formed by the caretaker government to resolve the crisis. He then established a Peace and Order Maintaining Command (POMC) with himself as its commander. Charged with the duty to "restore peace to the people from all sides without delay", the POMC was initially given the power to "prevent, suppress, abate and resolve" any situation affecting national security, to enforce every provision of the martial law, and to summon any person. General Prayut also ordered the personnel of the police, navy, air force and Ministry of Defence to be subject to the POMC.[21][22]

In Bangkok, soldiers were stationed in many places[23] and the main roads were blockaded.[24] The military retook the Government House from the PDRC protesters[25] and seized all television stations in Bangkok and some other parts of the country[26][27] before shutting down some stations, including those of the PDRC and the Red Shirts.[28] General Prayut later ordered all media to replace their regular programs with the POMC programs whenever he required.[29] and imposed a ban on publishing information which might affect the military's mission.[30] He also directed all government agency chiefs to report to him.[31]

On 21 May 2014, the POMC established an Internet censorship task force and ordered Internet service providers to report to it in order to control online content.[32]

The caretaker government complained that it had not been consulted about the martial law-related decisions of the army. The army claimed that the move was not a coup d'état and that the government remained in office.[33]

Unsuccessful talks

Yingluck Shinawatra, leader of landslide voted government
After its establishment, the POMC held talks with rival groups for two days in an attempt to find resolution. It was reported that the participants were of conflicting opinions and no agreement could be adopted.[34] During talks, the caretaker government was requested by the Election Commission to resign.[35] The government denied the request, saying it was required by the constitution to stay in office.[36] The 2007 constitution prescribed that the cabinet vacates office en bloc upon dissolution of the House of Representatives but it shall remain in office and continue to function until a new cabinet takes office.[37]

On the afternoon of 22 May 2014, the POMC held another talk at the Thai Army Club on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road[34] The talk had proceeded for five hours[38] without reaching agreement, whilst the government maintained that it bore a legal duty to remain in office. At the meeting, General Prayut eventually said to Minister of Justice Chaikasem Nitisiri who led the government representatives: "The talk knows no end because you all only speak about the law. [...] The government insists that it won't resign, right?" Chaikasem replied: "Not at this moment". General Prayut then told the meeting that "Sorry, I must seize power"[39][40] and ordered the detention of the cabinet members as well as the leaders of the PDRC, Red Shirts, and political parties who attended the talk, much to the dismay of the media representatives who were present.[34] They were held at the headquarters of the 1st Infantry Regiment of the King's Guard, in Phaya Thai District.[41]

Launch
On the evening of 22 May 2014, General Prayut announced through a televised address that the armed forces were assuming control of national administration,[42] formally launching a coup d'état against the caretaker government and establishing the NCPO to rule the state.[34]

Later that night, the NCPO repealed the 2007 constitution, save the second chapter which deals with the king.[43]: 10  In addition, it formally ordered the dissolution of the caretaker government, but the Senate as well as all other state agencies, including the courts and the independent organs, were kept intact.[44] The NCPO declared its composition as follows:[45]

General Prayut (RTA Commander) as its leader,
General Thanasak Patimaprakorn (Chief of Defence Forces), Admiral Narong Pipathanasai (Royal Thai Navy Commander), Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong (Royal Thai Air Force Commander), and Police General Adul Saengsingkaew (Royal Thai Police Commissioner General), as its deputy leaders,
General Udomdet Sitabut (RTA Deputy Commander) as its secretary general.
The NCPO then announced that its leader would exercise all powers and duties which the laws invest in the prime minister and the cabinet, until there was a new prime minister.[46][47] It placed its members in charge of government ministries and equivalent agencies.[48][49]

On 24 May 2014, the NCPO dissolved the existing Senate and granted legislative powers to its leader.[50] It ordered the judicial branch to operate under its directives.[51] It transferred Police General Adul to an inactive post in the Office of the Prime Minister and replaced him with Police General Watcharapol Prasarnrajkit. Adul was seen as a loyalist of the deposed government.[50]

Arrest and detention of public figures
Immediately after the coup was launched, caretaker Prime Minister Niwatthamrong, who did not attend the talks, left his office at the Ministry of Commerce so as to avoid being apprehended by the military.[36][52] The NCPO ordered him and the cabinet members who were not detained to report to the military that day.[53] It was reported that Niwatthamrong attempted to establish a government-in-exile at the United States embassy in Bangkok, but the embassy denied the report.[54]

On the night of 22 May 2014, military officers detained additional politicians, including Chalerm Yubamrung and his sons.[55] The following day, the NCPO summoned PTP members and Shinawatra family members, including Yingluck.[56][57] Niwatthamrong and Yingluck surrendered themselves to the NCPO on that day.[58] Yingluck was detained at an undisclosed "safe house".[59][60] The NCPO said it released her on 25 May.[61]

The NCPO later summoned another 114 prominent figures from both sides[62] and stated that those who refused to submit to it would be apprehended and prosecuted.[63] Activist Sombat Boonngamanong, better known as Dotty Editor, was the first person who refused to surrender, saying "Hilarious. Not reporting [to the junta] is considered a criminal offense." He challenged the summons with a post on Facebook: "Catch me if you can".[64][65] The NCPO responded by stating that on the morning of 24 May, it would send soldiers to apprehend those who failed to appear.[66] One of those apprehended on that day was Panthongtae Shinawatra, a nephew of Yingluck.[67] Sombat was eventually apprehended on 5 June 2014 in Chon Buri Province. The military tracked him down through the Internet, using the IP address he used to post his comments.[68] In addition to two years in jail for violating its orders, the military said Sombat will face seven years of imprisonment on grounds of encouraging people to violate its orders, which are the "law of the nation". The military also said that those who provided refuge to Sombat were to be dealt with by two years in jail on account of "harbouring a criminal".[69]

The NCPO also summoned the Bangkok diplomatic corps to its headquarters. In its summons, it said the corps were merely "invited" to a meeting with the military figures, so that they would have "correct understanding" of its mission.[70] Many foreign ambassadors, including German Ambassador Rolf Peter Schulze, refused to go.[71]

Former Minister of Education Chaturon Chaisaeng was the first person to be tried in a military court for failing to appear as summoned by the NCPO. Soldiers apprehended Chaturon in front of a crowd of foreign journalists immediately after giving a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand on 27 May 2014. An NCPO spokesman said that holding a press conference with foreign media was deemed improper and against NCPO policy.[72][73][74] Chaturon faced fourteen years of imprisonment in consequence of computer crime charges.[75]

Martial law allows the military to detain people for no more than seven days.[18] The NCPO did not observe the time limit. Some individuals were held incommunicado for more than three weeks.[76]

Control of public activities and media
Upon announcing the coup, the NCPO laid down a ban on political gatherings and directed all protesters to disperse.[45] It ordered all educational institutes, both public and private, to close from 23 to 25 May 2014.[77] It imposed a curfew throughout the country, ordering people to stay indoors from 22:00 to 05:00.[78] The curfew time was later changed to 24:00 to 04:00 hours, effective 28 May 2014.[79] The curfew was lifted in most parts of the country on 13 June 2014.[80]

The NCPO ordered all television and radio stations to stop airing their regular programs and to broadcast RTA programs only.[81] It detained Wanchai Tantiwittayapitak, deputy director of the Thai Public Broadcasting Service which operates Thai PBS station, after he permitted the station to live broadcast a special program about the coup on YouTube instead of television.[82][83] On the program, several scholars, including Chulalongkorn University lecturer Gothom Arya, were interviewed and gave negative comments on the coup.[84] Thai PBS said Wanchai was taken to the First Army Area headquarters to "tune in understanding between the media and army".[85]

On 23 May 2014, the NCPO summoned all media chiefs to the Thai Army Club and ordered Internet service providers to censor any information deemed provocative, causing public disturbance, containing official secrets, likely detrimental to national security, or defamatory to the NCPO.[86] It threatened to shut down social media if its operator failed to block information inciting unrest or inciting "opposition to peacekeeping".[87]

On the afternoon of 23 May, analogue television networks, except Thai PBS, were allowed to resume their normal programming,[88] after the NCPO ordered the Internet service providers to block all broadcast sharing attempts on the Internet and instructed the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission to shut down Internet-based television.[89] All digital television networks were permitted to resume broadcasts the following day.[90]

On 24 May 2014, media organisations issued an open letter urging the NCPO to end the restriction of press freedom as soon as possible.[91] The NCPO responded by summoning all media operators, instructing them that they were required to attend a meeting with the NCPO first.[92]

Aftermath
Future roles
The NCPO stated on 23 May 2014 that it aimed to conduct national "economic, social and political" reforms before elections were permitted.[93][94] It said a reform council and a national assembly will be set up to work on the reforms.[95] It also said it wanted to handle, inter alia, the rice pledge project problems, and will carry out a project of constructing roads on both banks of the Chao Phraya River.[93] The road construction project was originally initiated by the PTP in 2012 and was part of a flood control project.[96]

General Prayut said he would run the country until the situation required an interim government.[95] In administering the country, he said he will use the military command and control systems which he believed would develop the country.[97] The NCPO announced that its leader would determine national administrative policies, both "short-term and long-term".[48]

Unlike previous coups, there were no promises of a quick return to civilian rule.[60] On 26 May, the NCPO held a press conference at which a Thai Rath journalist asked General Prayut if he would become the new prime minister himself. Prayut did not refuse, answering, "It is already in the plan." Another journalist, from the Bangkok Post, asked when an election would happen. Prayut replied, "[An election] depends on the situation. [There is] no deadline. That's enough", before walking out of the conference room.[98] The following day, both journalists were summoned by the NCPO on grounds of "giving questions that lessen public confidence in the ruler".[99]

An NCPO spokesman also said that normal democratic principles could not be applied at the current time.[100] The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the military's decisions showed that General Prayut is preparing "a long-term pervasive takeover without the calling of quick elections".[101]

On 29 May 2014, Lieutenant General Chatchalerm Chalermsukh, deputy army chief of staff, told reporters at a press conference in Bangkok, that while elections would be held, there was no timetable. "Right conditions" would have to be put in place before an election took place, he said. A day later, in a national television address, General Prayut said elections would not be held for at least fifteen months. He warned against resistance to the military and called on all sides to co-operate and stop protesting.

Some observers believe that elections are being postponed due to issues of succession to the throne of Thailand. The king's "...death will shake Thailand like nothing has in its modern history, and the Thai military wants to be firmly in charge when that happens. It is that simple."[102]

Royal endorsement

Proclamation on Appointment of Leader of the National Council for Peace and Order
On 24 May 2014, the NCPO said King Bhumibol Adulyadej had acknowledged the coup, but stopped short of describing the response as an endorsement.[103] However, on 26 May 2014 the king formally appointed General Prayut to run the country. In Thailand the monarchy is highly respected and royal endorsement was seen as legitimation of the takeover.[104]

Lèse majesté cases
At a press conference on 23 May 2014, the NCPO said one of its missions is to "severely" deal with lèse majesté offenders in Thailand and ordered governmental officers to support this mission.[97]

On 25 May 2014, the NCPO authorised military courts to try all cases concerning lèse majesté, sedition, national security, and violation of NCPO orders.[105]

On that day, the NCPO searched the residence of Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, an imprisoned magazine editor sentenced in 2013 to 11 years in jail for lèse majesté. The NCPO detained his wife, who had been campaigning for political prisoners, and his son, a fourth year student at the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University.[106] Other critics of the lèse majesté law were detained as well.[107]

The NCPO later summoned a number of exiled activists accused of lèse majesté, including former Chulalongkorn University political science lecturer Giles Ji Ungpakorn and former minister Jakrapob Penkair. They were ordered to appear by 9 June 2014.[108]

Interim constitution
Main article: 2014 interim constitution of Thailand
An interim constitution was enacted on 22 July 2014, paving the way for the establishment of a national legislature, a provisional government, and a reform council.[109] The draft interim constitution originally required that a draft new constitution be approved by the citizens in a nationwide referendum before it is forwarded to the king for his signature. The requirement was disapproved by the NCPO and was deleted.[110] Wissanu Krea-ngam, a Chulalongkorn University law lecturer who drafted the interim constitution, explained that the requirement was deleted to avoid "lengthy process".[111]

Rise of fascism
The rise of fascism in Thailand began around the coup, first coined by James Taylor of University of Adelaide in 2011,[112] after the junta took control, academics and political commentators started to identify a political system by fascism. Pithaya Pookaman and James Taylor called it 'New Right', consisting of ultraconservatives, reactionaries, semi-fascists, pseudo-intellectuals and former leftists.[113][114] John Draper, an academic and political commentator, noted that the rise of fascism in Thailand began in 2014.[115] The King's sufficient economy was mentioned that it serves as one of the ideological foundations of the military regime, and reminiscent of fascist regimes in Europe in the 1930s.[116]

2017 constitution
In the run-up to the 7 August 2016 referendum on the new constitution, the army conducted a "grassroots information campaign." There was no debate permitted on its merits.[117] Under the junta's rules, "people who propagate information deemed distorted, violent, aggressive, inciting or threatening so that voters do not vote or vote in a particular way" faced up to 10 years in jail and a fine of up to 200,000 baht.[118] The 105-page, 279-article proposed constitution[119][120] was approved by 61.4 percent of Thai voters on 7 August 2016 with 59.4 percent of the public participating.[121] Under the proposed constitution, Parliament is bicameral, consisting of a 250-member nominated Senate and a 500-member House of Representatives of whom 350 are elected from single-member constituencies, and 150 members from party lists.[120] The proposed constitution also allows the NCPO to appoint an eight to ten person panel who will choose Senators,[122] to include six seats reserved for the heads of the Royal Thai Army, Navy, Air Force, and Police, plus the military's supreme commander, and defense permanent secretary. The bicameral Parliament could also select a candidate as Prime Minister who is not one of its members or even a politician. That person could become Prime Minister if the appointed Senate approves. Some suspect that with the new constitution the military seeks to hobble political parties in order to create disposable coalition governments. The military would then remain the real power, whatever the outcome of the referendum and the election.[118]
